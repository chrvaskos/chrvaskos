## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Vasilis. 
I'm passionate about web development, and especially the front-end. 
I've graduated from Aristotle University of Thessaloniki with a BSc in Computer Science. 
Right now I'm working on creating a portfolio of projects where I can show off my skills and love about what I do. 
In addition to that, I'm trying to document & share everything new and interesting I learn through my blog posts.

I encourage you to visit my personal website / blog to learn more about me!
You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christoforidis-vasileios/), as well!
